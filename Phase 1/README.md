## Requirement

In Project Phase 1, need to write two User Defined Functions ST\_Contains and ST\_Within in SparkSQL and use them to do four spatial queries:

* Range query: Use ST_Contains. Given a query rectangle R and a set of points P, find all the points within R.
* Range join query: Use ST_Contains. Given a set of Rectangles R and a set of Points S, find all (Point, Rectangle) pairs such that the point is within the rectangle.
* Distance query: Use ST_Within. Given a point location P and distance D in km, find all points that lie within a distance D from P
* Distance join query: Use ST_Within. Given a set of Points S1 and a set of Points S2 and a distance D in km, find all (s1, s2) pairs such that s1 is within a distance D from s2 (i.e., s1 belongs to S1 and s2 belongs to S2).


A Scala SparkSQL code template is given.
### The main function is in "SparkSQLExample.scala".

### The User Defined Functions that you need to implement are in "SpatialQuery.scala". Replace the query part with your code from the old template.



The detailed requirements are as follows:

### 1. ST_Contains

Input: pointString:String, queryRectangle:String

Output: Boolean (true or false)

Definition: You first need to parse the pointString (e.g., "-88.331492,32.324142") and queryRectangle (e.g., "-155.940114,19.081331,-155.618917,19.5307") to a format that you are comfortable with. Then check whether the queryRectangle fully contains the point. Consider on-boundary point.

### 2. ST_Within

Input: pointString1:String, pointString2:String, distance:Double

Output: Boolean (true or false)

Definition: Parsed the pointString1 (e.g., "-88.331492,32.324142") and pointString2 (e.g., "-88.331492,32.324142") to a format that you are comfortable with. Then check whether the two points are within the given distance. Consider on-boundary point. To simplify the problem, assumed all coordinates are on a planar space and calculate their Euclidean distance.

### 3. Used UDF in SparkSQL

Range query:
```
select * 
from point 
where ST_Contains(point._c0,'-155.940114,19.081331,-155.618917,19.5307')
```

Range join query:
```
select * 
from rectangle,point 
where ST_Contains(rectangle._c0,point._c0)
```

Distance query:
```
select * 
from point 
where ST_Within(point._c0,'-88.331492,32.324142',10)
```

Distance join query:
```
select * 
from point p1, point p2 
where ST_Within(p1._c0, p2._c0, 10)
```
